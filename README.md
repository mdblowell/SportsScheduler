# SportsScheduler
This is a command-line select option-'N' based league-schedule generator using a round-robin (RR) algorithm built using Python.

The program includes the following features:

  - Add or change your league name.
  - Add teams to your league manually (space character delimited)
  - Delete teams from your league manually.
  - Assign teams to divisions (manually or randomly/programmatically using RR).
  - Division options: 0, 2, or 4 divisions.
  - Display the current teams in your league/division.
  - Choose how many weeks to produce the scheduled games in your league.
  - A Round-Robin (RR) algorithm calculates and produces full schedule output to console only.
  - If the league has less than 16 teams, only 0 or 2 divisions are allowed for the league.
  - Two templates are available. An 8-Team and 16-Team; it creates 8 & 16 team leagues respectively, producing a schedule. 
    This allows you to assess how the program works.
  - Lastly, error checking was implemented to ensure the program doesn't quit if user input disrupts work flow of the program.
